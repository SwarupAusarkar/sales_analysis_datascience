A Python-based Data Science Project with Tkinter GUI for Visualizing and Forecasting Sales Trends.  

🚀 Features  
- 📂 Open CSV Files – Load any sales dataset dynamically  
- 📊 Daily, Weekly & Monthly Trends – Interactive visualizations  
- 🔮 Sales Forecasting – Predict sales for the next 30 days using Linear Regression  
- 🖥 Modern Tkinter GUI – Clean, user-friendly interface with interactive buttons  
- 🔍 Zoom, Pan & Save Graphs – Matplotlib toolbar for better analysis  

🖥 How to Run the Project  
1️⃣ Install Dependencies  
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install required libraries:  
```pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tk```  
2️⃣ Run the Script  
```python main.py```  
3️⃣ Load a Sales Dataset  
Click on **📂 Open CSV** and select a `.csv` file with sales data.  
4️⃣ Explore Sales Insights  
- 📅 Daily Sales – View revenue trends per day  
- 📈 Weekly & Monthly Trends – See average revenue across weeks & months  
- 🔮 Forecast – Predict the next 30 days of sales using machine learning  

📝 CSV Format  
Ensure your CSV has the following columns:  
| 📆 Date     | 💰 Daily_Revenue |  
|------------|--------------|  
| 01-01-2023 | 1500         |  
| 02-01-2023 | 1700         |  
| ...        | ...          |  

⚠️ If the CSV format is incorrect, the app will show an error message.
